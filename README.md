# mythic_access_frontend

A new Flutter project.

## About

This is my first Flutter frontend app, built for **mobile, web, and desktop**, designed to interface with my backend.  
Focus is on **accessibility** and providing a smooth user experience for all users.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
